# ~~cards~~~ Solitaire

This is a simple implementation of the Solitaire encryption algorithm, a keystream cipher using a deck of cards. It was written for the [Qoheleth ARG](http://post-self.io/entry/qoheleth-1), and was provided in an [obfuscated format](https://gist.github.com/but-death-must/0fedcbbb5e9839936ce799ece39fcd49), which was quite painful to write. Now that the ARG has been solved, though, I can deobfuscate the source and post that as well, to prove that not all Ruby I write is that ugly :)
